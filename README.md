Audit Every Dollar of Invoice Spend

* Reduce spend by proactively finding invoice errors and fraud
* Make sense of all contract terms and validate invoices against them
* Stay ahead of auto-renewals and early discount opportunities

The purpose of an energy bill audit is to find mistakes and cost saving opportunities with your energy bill(s) and to recommend/employ changes that will help lower energy costs.

Monthly Utility Bill Audits
Companies with monthly energy bill audits have someone — either in-house or an outside company — who audits every energy bill that the company receives on an ongoing basis.  Monthly audits are usually considered by larger companies where shaving off even a little bit of an electric or gas bill could result in hundreds or even thousands of dollars in savings.

One-Time Utility Bill Audits
This is exactly how it sounds — any type or size of business can benefit from a one time audit.  A company will send us (our parent company) an energy bill and it’ll be thoroughly analyzed for savings and opportunities and advise accordingly.
